Softjourn VMT Code Test

Overview:
PIXI bunnies are spreading on Softjourn's green offices. Be the first to control them!

Controls:
[1] [Bunnies No.] <input type='number'> The amount of bunnies displayed. By changing this value a user should add/remove items.
[2] [Bunny Size] <input type='range'> Scale value of the selected items
[3] [Bunny Rotation] <input type='range'> Rotation value of the selected items

Task:
[1] Complete the <BunnyListInputs> component so the input values and the BunnyItems are updated.
[2] Implement multiple selection for bunnies when they are clicked.
[3] Implement controls [2] and [3] for the selected bunnies.

Notes:
* When items are added/removed, the remained items should keep their existing scale/rotation properties.
* When deselecting an item it should keep its existing properties.
* Nice to have, position() bunnies on multiple rows when first row gets filled.

Use of Codepen is not required, you can export the pen.
The task is expected in 2 days.
Good luck!!
